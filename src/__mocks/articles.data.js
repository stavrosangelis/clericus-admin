          "<p>The Royal Catholic College of St Patrick was founded in 1795, by act of the Irish Parliament. It was intended to replace the network of Irish continental colleges whose activities were severely curtailed by the French Revolution. The college trained Catholic clergy and it also housed, for a time, a lay college. In 1896, to mark its centenary, a Pontifical University was  established on the campus, with courses in philosophy, theology and canon law. About a decade later, in 1908, the college became a recognised college of the Royal University of Ireland, forerunner of the National University of Ireland. In the 1960s, the college's faculties of arts, science, philosophy and celtic studies faculties began to accept non-ecclesiastical students, with the seminary and pontifical univeristy continuing to operate as before. By the Universities act of 1997, the college's arts, science, philosophy and celtic studies faculties were erected into an independent college of the National University of Ireland, called the National University of Ireland Maynooth. St Patrick's College continues to function as a seminary, with theology degrees conferred by the Pontifical University. </p>",

          '<div>\n<div>Clericus is a digital humanities research project that aims to develop a database on the Irish clerical population for the early modern and modern periods. Phase I of the project, financed by St. Patrick\'s College Maynooth (SPCM), focused on the students and faculty of St. Patrick\'s College, historically Ireland\'s largest seminary and pontifical university. The principal sources used were class portraits and student lists compiled by Monsignor Patrick J. Hamell and Cora Fennelly. This combined dataset provides just under <strong>20,000</strong> individual biographical entries. In line with data protection recommendations, all class portraits and biographical entries up to and including 1945 are available via the website\'s database (48 <a href="../classpieces">class portraits</a> and approximately <strong>14,000</strong> entries).</div>\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>September 2020 marked the beginning of Phase II of the Clericus Project. Over the following months the project expanded its database on the Irish clerical population and digital preservation initiative through collaboration with several new institutions. The project first sought to expand the database’s existing information on clerical students through the addition of biographical data relating to the ministry of a subset of the clerical population based in the Diocese of Meath.The Clericus team extracted relevant data from the well-known and recently updated <a href="../resource/55466"><em>History of the Diocese of Meath, 1860-1993</em></a>. In total, over <strong>750</strong> new biographical entries were created for the period 1690 to 1941.</p>\n<p>Apart from deepening our understanding of individual career paths and networks, this work package permitted the project to further test, develop and showcase the database’s dynamic qualities through the integration and synergy of data from several heterogeneous sources. This, in turn, offered the practical experience and customised system necessary to handle a range of new sources and data during future stages of the project. </p>\n<p>Following the successful completion of the Meath work package, Clericus expanded its spatial/geographical range by focusing on the international dimension of the Irish Catholic Church and its clergy. This came in the form of a collaborative project with the Irish Cultural Centre, Paris and members of the academic research community. The project was kindly provided with a dataset compiled by Dr Liam Chambers and Dr Sarah Franks on the student population of the <a href="../resource/63451">Irish College Paris (ICP)</a>. This dataset was compiled using student records from the college’s archives (available <a href="https://archives-en.centreculturelirlandais.com/archives-en">here</a>), and included over <strong>2,000</strong> student entries covering the period 1832 up to the college’s evacuation at the outbreak of World War II. This represents a rich source of information regarding the biographies of individual students, such as information relating to dates of birth, baptism, confirmation, subjects studied and other observations. The value of the data to members of the public researching their family history is increased due to the inclusion of parents\' names (including maiden names) for over half of the students. Almost <strong>200</strong> ICP students would also spend time studying at St Patrick\'s College Maynooth (SPCM), which in turn deepens our understanding of individual formation and career paths. One excellent example to highlight this enrichment process is seen in <a href="9027">Kevin Clark</a> of Meath diocese, whose database entry draws on information from every resource utilised within the Clericus system up until that point.</p>\n<p>The second phase also saw the project expand its temporal range to include data from the early modern period. Several of the most comprehensive records for Ireland’s seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Catholic clergy were identified. As part of this process, the Clericus team recently completed the ingestion of over <strong>1,500</strong> new biographical entries relating to Irish clerical students from the Universities of Paris and Toulouse during the period 1573 to 1792. This data is drawn from the impressive prosopography on the Irish student community created by <a href="../resource/86488">L. W. B. Brockliss and Patrick Ferté</a>. Many of these students were tied to the Irish College Paris (ICP), and the ingestion of this data expands our database to include a large percentage of the individuals who attended the seminary college across the almost four centuries of its existence. Completing this work package has provided the Clericus team with the experience and knowledge necessary to undertake similar work packages on the numerous other Irish colleges active on the continent during the early modern and modern periods. This includes ongoing work being carried out on the ordinations of Irish students in Lisbon and oaths taken by the student body of the Irish College Salamanca. Part of this process has also involved work on a data template to help standrdise and streamline the ingestion of data into the Clericus database.</p>\n<p>No research on the early modern clergy would be complete without having covered Ireland\'s penal laws. Our understanding of the impact of these restrictions on the Catholic Church has advanced greatly over the last fifty years or so. However, the number and identities of the Catholic clergy active on the Irish mission during the ‘Long eighteenth century’ remains unclear. One aim of the Clericus project has been to help fill this lacuna in our knowledge by compiling the first comprehensive database on this population. The Clericus system is ideally suited to completing this important task, while the dynamic nature of our system and data model permits us to identify, capture and chart the social and professional networks, both clerical and lay, that these individuals maintained across Ireland and the continent. This will add layers of complexity and nuance to our data and subsequent understanding of the worlds navigated by thousands, if not tens of thousands of these individuals. </p>\n<p>The first building block of this monumental undertaking was a dataset compiled from the <a href="../article/irelands-popish-parish-priest-in-1704-">1704 clergy registration</a>. Access to a rare copy of this document was kindly provided to the Clericus team by the archivists of The Honourable Society of King’s Inn, Dublin. The registration of Ireland’s ‘Popish Parish Priests’ in 1704 represents one of the most valuable records concerning the island’s eighteenth-century Catholic clergy – the document covers the entire country for one year and provides relatively detailed information on each cleric. This includes their name, place of abode, parish(es), date of ordination, where they received orders, from whom (i.e. bishop) and two lay individuals acting as sureties or guarantors for each priest. In total, the document lists <strong>1,089</strong> priests, just over <strong>800</strong> lay sureties and several dozen Irish and foreign bishops. Carrying out this work package made it necessary to expand the number of organisations (i.e. townlands, parishes and dioceses) and spatial locations within the Clericus system, including many examples found outside of Ireland. This process also led to the further development of the system’s taxonomy, with the number of event types and relation types in particular having grown to meet the demands imposed by such a sizeable and complex dataset.</p>\n<p>Following the ingestion of this data, work on the Clericus system briefly moved away from large datasets to focus instead on smaller, more numerous resources. The aim behind this was to further enrich individual careers to a degree not yet seen in the database by providing granular biographical data and important network linkages between entries within the system. To achieve this, a selection of documents relating to the clergy of Dublin diocese covering twenty years either side of 1704 was chosen. This included a government census of <a href="../article/sculking-about-the-towne-the-clergy-of-dublin-diocese-in-1698">Dublin’s clergy in 1698</a>, a <a href="../article/lobbying-and-last-wills-and-testaments">testimony and will</a> relating to Bishop <a href="77739">John Dempsey</a> from 1693 and 1703 respectively and a second will from c.1728 belonging to an associated cleric, <a href="76511">Dominic Edward Murphy</a>. The work carried out enriching their biographical entries has provided the testbed and framework necessary to undertake similar work packages relating to other biographical entries already present in the Clericus system. </p>\n<p>Earlier this year the Clericus team was joined by Dr Ciaran Reilly as part of a project that seeks to utilise the <a href="../article/obituaries-as-a-source-for-clericus-">obituaries</a> of Maynooth educated priests as a source of information to help further enrich biographical entries contained within the database. To date over <strong>350</strong> obituaries have been identified from c.1860-1900 which relate to clerics already entered in the Clericus database. While this is admittedly a small sample, the obituaries as a source are quite revealing. These obituaries allow the potential to further expand the dataset and establish networks based on associational culture and/or familial connections. In addition, similar biographical information is also present in month’s mind notices, notices of charitable bequests and others reports, but these are not as common as obituaries. From an international perspective, these obituaries provide important information on clerics who ministered in the <a href="../article/maynooth-clerics-in-st-louis">USA</a>, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, revealing the key roles such individuals played in establishing the Catholic Church in these countries.</p>\n<p>Finally, between October and December of this year, the Clericus project will once again turn its focus to the student population of an Irish seminary. With the assistance of a Kevin B. Nolan Digitisation Grant from the Royal Irish Academy (RIA), the Clericus team will capture and ingest student data and class portraits belonging to St. Kieran’s College, Kilkenny. Between 1793 and 1994, St. Kieran’s acted as one of Ireland’s nine diocesan seminaries and educated several thousand clerical students over the course of two centuries. Of the estimated <strong>2,000</strong> who were ultimately ordained for the priesthood, almost two-thirds were dispatched to missions in the United States, Great Britain, Australia and various other countries. Furthermore, this digitisation initiative will also provide members of the Irish public and diaspora with an accessible and interactive digital platform through which to undertake genealogical research.</p>\n<p>To read more about the project and its content, please see the \'<a href="../article-category/articles">Articles</a>\' section on the Clericus website.

          '<p>The Classpieces page is made up of two columns, the <strong>Filters</strong> column on the left and the <strong>Classpieces</strong> column on the right.</p>\n<h4>Filters</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Filters</strong> column allows the visitor to filter the list of items shown in the <strong>Classpieces</strong> column. The available filters are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Event types</li>\n<li>Organisations</li>\n<li>Dates</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Event types</h5>\n<p>The <strong>Event types</strong> filter allows the visitor to filter by an associated event type. When a visitor selects one or more event type filters the classpieces list will only display classpieces that are associated with the events of that type.</p>\n<h5>Organisations</h5>\n<p>The <strong>Organisations</strong> filter allows the visitor to filter by one or more associated organisations. When a visitor selects one or more organisations the classpieces list will only display classpieces that are associated with these organisations. There is an additional dropdown list that filters organisations by their respective type to allow the visitor to locate the desired organisations more easily.</p>\n<h5>Dates</h5>\n<p>The <strong>Dates</strong> filter allows the visitor to filter by dates. First the visitor must select the type of the date match from a drop down list. The date match type may be one of the following: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Exact</li>\n<li>Before</li>\n<li>After</li>\n<li>In Range</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the visitor selects one of the three first types she/he then must set the date. A datepicker is available to help select the proper date more easily and ensure that the date is supplied in the correct format (dd/mm/yyyy). If the visitor selects the last option, In Range one input appears to allow the visitor to input the appropriate end date.<br />The visitor must trigger the filter by clicking the submit button.</p>\n<h5>General remarks</h5>\n<p>The filters work in combination. Each time a visitor selects a filter the filters themselves are also filtered and only the values that may be applied to the available subset of classpieces remain visible, thus enabling further filtering the results.</p>\n<p>Every search filter has a small <em><strong>clear </strong></em>button. This button clears only the selected values of that specific filter. There is also a generic <em><strong>clear all </strong></em>button next to the <strong>Filters</strong> heading that clears all the selected filters. </p>\n<p>When a visitor sets filters the filter values are stored in the memory. When the visitor navigates back to the classpieces webpage the filters are still active. This memory is reset when the visitor refreshes the webpage or opens it in a new window/tab.</p>\n<h4>Classpieces</h4>\n<p>The classpieces column contains the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the number of total items</li>\n<li>the search bar</li>\n<li>the limit dropdown list</li>\n<li>the pagination</li>\n<li>the list of classpieces</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Number of total items</h5>\n<p>This number is updated when the visitor sets filters and/or performs a search to reflect the total number of matches.</p>\n<h5>Search bar</h5>\n<p>The search bar visibility may be toggled by clicking the lens icon next to the number of total items. The search bar has a generic search input where the visitor may enter a search term. This term is matched against the labels of the classpieces and the results are returned. To submit the search the visitor may either press the enter key or click on the search button next to the search input. The search input contains a round x button that works as a clear search button, when a visitor clicks this button the search term is removed and the system returns all the classpieces.</p>\n<h5>Limit</h5>\n<p>The Limit dropdown is where the visitor sets the number of items she/he wishes to view per page.</p>\n<h5>Pagination</h5>\n<p>The pagination allows the visitor to navigate through the available pages of classpieces. The visitor may navigate to the first/last page, next/previous page or to a page number. The user may also input a page number directly, a feature that may prove useful when there is a very big number of pages.</p>\n<h5>List of classpieces</h5>\n<p>The list of classpieces contains a list of the available classpieces per page. This list changes according to the filters set by the visitor and the search term. Each item in the list contains the thumbnail of a classpiece and the label of the classpiece.</p>',

The first phase of the project, financed by St. Patrick's College Maynooth, focuses on the students and faculty of St. Patrick's College, historically Ireland's largest seminary and pontifical university. The principal sources used were class portraits and student lists compiled by Monsignor Patrick J. Hamell and Cora Fennelly.</p>\n</div>\n<p>This phase of the project ran from January to June 2020 and involved the digitisation of 124 student class portraits (class pieces). The class pieces date from the second half of the nineteenth century to 2018, and provide a unique pictorial record of a significant student body with links to many families within Ireland and the wider Irish diaspora. Class pieces dating up to and including 1941 are available via the website for consultation by researchers and members of the general public. Each individual student portrait is supplemented with biographical information taken from student lists for the college - covering the period from the seminary's establishment in 1795 up until 2002 - compiled by Patrick J. Hamell and Cora Fennelly. This data includes records of students who matriculated into St. Patrick’s, but for whom no record of ordination exists. This combined dataset provides just under 20,000 individual biographical entries, of which all entries up to and including 1941 are available via the website's database. At a future stage in the project, it is envisaged that the information in this dataset will be supplemented with biographical information from additional collections held within SPCM’s rich archives and in other external sources.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Clericus offers researchers a powerful digital tool for the study of one of the most important social and professional cohorts in Irish history.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Apart from making these resources available to researchers and the general public, the project aims to preserve the artefacts in an accessible and interactive digital format. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The project's team are:</p>\n<p>Prof Thomas O'Connor, Principal Investigator</p>\n<p>Stavros Angelis, Chief Technical Officer</p>\n<p>Chun-Hung Chen, Technical Assistant</p>\n<p>Dr Tony Farrell, Research Assistant</p>\n<p>Dr Richard Fitzpatrick, Research Assistant &amp; Content Manager </p>\n<p>June 2020</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>",

          "<p>September 2020 marks the beginning of Phase II of the Clericus Project, a digital humanities initiative based in the Arts and Humanities Institute, Maynooth University. Following a successful partnership with St. Patrick’s College Maynooth in Phase I, the project aims to expand its database on the Irish clerical population and digital preservation initiative through collaboration with several new institutions. This will include working closely with a number of diocesan seminaries to identify and ingest several thousand additional biographical records for clerical students covering the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Where available, it is also planned to digitally capture and preserve student class pieces and other artefacts of historical significance.</p>\n<p>The project further aims to expand the database’s existing information on clerical students through the addition of biographical data relating to the ministry of a subset of the clerical population. This will involve extracting relevant data from one of Ireland’s diocesan histories. Apart from deepening our understanding of individual career paths and networks, this will permit the project to further test, develop and showcase the database’s dynamic qualities through the integration and synergy of data from several heterogeneous sources. This, in turn, will offer the practical experience and customised system necessary to handle a range of new sources and data during future phases of the project.</p>\n<p>The second phase will also see the project expand its temporal range to include data from the early modern period. Several of the most comprehensive records for Ireland’s seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Catholic clergy have been identified, and their inclusion will once again help to expand the database’s value to researchers from different disciplines. In particular, the mapping of this data will add a new dimension to the study and understanding of the clerical population during what was both a turbulent and formative period in their history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The second phase project team are:</p>\n<p>Prof Thomas O'Connor, Principal Investigator</p>\n<p>Stavros Angelis, Chief Technical Officer</p>\n<p>Dr Richard Fitzpatrick, Research Assistant &amp; Content Manager</p>\n<p>September 2020</p>",

          '<p>The Clericus Project logo is based on the pontifical cross of Salem as depicted on the <a href="../classpiece/848">1914-15</a> class piece for St. Patrick’s College Maynooth. The students’ choice of this symbol to adorn their class portrait was probably complex. It no doubt refers, for instance, to the well-known  association between the Pope and the Old Testament figure of Melchizedek, the ‘king of Salem [peace] and priest of the Most High God’ (Hebrews 7:1). Thus, the adoption of the three-barred cross acted as a simple yet explicit acknowledgement by the Catholic seminarians of the Pope’s temporal and spiritual powers. The seminarians may also have been professing their devotion to Jesus, the new high priest, who ‘has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek’ (Hebrews 6:20). Melchizedek, it is said, was ‘without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever’ (Hebrews 7:3). The adoption of the cross of Salem, therefore, was a symbolic representation of their ordination as priests,  eternally devoted to Christ ‘The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, \'You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.\' (Psalm 110:4). The three barred cross is commonly associated with the Orthodox Church.</p>',

The <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> library is being employed for the graph data visualisations, expanded with <a href="https://www.pixijs.com/" target="_blank">PixiJS</a> for better performance and more efficient rendering. <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> is the javascript library employed for making the responsive map visualisations. Finally <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, an extension to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a> stylesheet language, is being employed to add modern and efficient styling to the application.</p>\n<p>The CDPI offers access to the data and content of the project. The user experience adn navigation has been developed through many circles of software requirements specification with the content team of the project and a user experience exercise with domain experts of different backgrounds where, among others, the Usability, Utility and Desirability of the application were measured.</p>\n<h4>Main Features</h4>\n<p>The CDPI is organised in views and components. The Home screen is the main entry view where users are presented with a custom carousel that showcases interesting aspects of the collection, some interesting statistics about the contents of the collection, general information about the project, article highlights about important figures in the Clericus project population, the project news, a welcome text and direct access to the available visualisations.</p>\n<p>An articles\' list and an article view are available. For all article categories and articles, search engine optimised permalinks are automatically created by the system. Each article contains rich content and details about the creator of the article and the date of the last update.</p>\n<p>A classpieces grid view is available. Through this view visitors may search and browse through classpieces and filter them by related event types and dates.</p>\n<p>An individual classpiece view is also available. This view contains all details related to a classpiece (e.g. when the classpiece was compiled, which people are depicted on the classpiece etc) as well as a custom classpiece viewer. Through the classpiece viewer visitors can see details about people depicted on the classpiece by hovering the mouse cursor over them and view the individual person\'s page by clicking into the marked area on the screen. A search functionality is also available that will highlight a selected person on the classpiece.</p>\n<p>A people list view is available. This view allows visitors to search for people and an advanced search feature is also available. Visitors may also filter results by related event types, related sources and dates.</p>\n<p>Similar list views and individual record views have been developed for the main entities of the data model, i) events, ii) organisations, iii) resources, iv) temporal and v) spatial. These views are not part of the main navigation but can still be accessed through links to individual related items and the navigation breadcrumbs.</p>\n<p>Three main visualisation components have been developed to provide visitors with more intuitive ways to view, understand and interact with the data. These are i) the heatmap, ii) the events timeline and iii) the network graph.</p>\n<p>The Heatmap visualisation is a graphical representation of the distribution of people contained within the Clericus database, that are associated with a diocese. The heatmap shows hotspots depending on the number of people associated with a location. The color of each hotspot on the map indicates the population density for that location as shown in more detail in the legend at the bottom right corner of the heatmap. Depending on the zoom level the locations form clusters. When visitors put their mouse over a cluster a polygon appears with each location being represented by the appropriate polygon corner. Individual locations are represented by a marker pin. Clicking on a marker pin will open a small popup with the locations details, i.e. the name of the associated diocese and it\'s associated people. The heatmap component is a custom component based on <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>.</p>\n<p>The Events timeline is a graphical representation of the events list ordered in chronological order. Each item of this list shows a date and the number of associated events with that date. The items are color coded to make it easier for the visitors to distinguish between them. Clicking on an item will open up a small popup window with the list of all associated events with that date. Clicking on the event will show all associated entities with that event. The Events timeline is a custom component built specifically for the project\'s needs.</p>\n<p>The Network graph visualisation represents the list of relationships between the various entities held in the Clericus database. Each node has a different color according to it\'s type, as explained in the legend at the bottom right corner. Clicking on a node will open up a popup window showing the node details. All related nodes and links between the selected node and the related nodes will be highlighted as well. This node details window contains the label and type of the node and it\'s related nodes. The visitor can extend that selection by updating the steps between the selected node and the related nodes. This means that when steps is set to 1 only nodes that are directly related with the selected node will be shown. If the steps are set to 2 all nodes that are directly related with the selected node will be shown as well as all the nodes that are related with them, thus extending the associated network by one step. Upon updating the steps all related nodes and links will be highlighted. The Network graph visualisation is a process that heavily affects the performance of the system. Many optimisation and caching techniques were used to minimise any possible performance drop for the visitors, however the number of entities and relationships represented on this visualisation can be too much for the visitor\'s browser. The Network graph component has been built on <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> and <a href="https://www.pixijs.com/" target="_blank">PixiJS</a> has been employed to achieve better performance.</p>\n<p>The visualisations components are always under development. As the database grows and expands we try to find better ways to represent the data and optimise the performance of the visualisations.</p>',

          '<p><a href="../person/6295">Daniel O’Sullivan</a> (Dómhnall O Suilleabháin)  Kerry diocese, entered St Patrick’s College, Maynooth in 1907 and was ordained in 1914. A son of Dan and Hannah O\'Sullivan of High Street, Killarney, county Kerry, following ordination O’Sullivan was sent to work at St Brendan\'s Seminary where he had been educated himself. Following a call from the Bishop of Kerry, <a href="../person/42868">John Mangan</a> for a chaplain to serve the men from the diocese who had enlisted in British war effort, O’Sullivan answered the call.</p>\n<p>On 5 July 1916, just five days after the start of the infamous Battle of the Somme, O’Sullivan was killed by shrapnel while ministering to a wounded soldier. A poem in his memory was published the following week in the <em>Kerry News</em>:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong></p>\n<p>Captain Donal O’Sullivan chaplain to the Forces. Born in Killarney. Educated at Maynooth. Killed in France, July 1916.</p>\n<p><em>The laughter of the little days gone by. The memory of some unforgotten smile, with priestly blood spilt on the altar steps are hard to reconcile. </em></p>\n<p><em>From converse with his comrades of the school, from words of home and the caress of friends, who dreamed the Lord would snatch away so soon, an Isaac for his ends.</em></p>\n<p><em>Yet rest content, ye cloisters of Maynooth. Smile gently o’er Killarney, summer sun, for God who called to swift reward and true, first saw his work well done. </em></p>\n<p><em>And ye who nearest to the undying dead, must weep o’er vacant chair and shattered shrine, be sure that God behind this cloud doth veil, some sure august design. </em></p>\n<p><strong>L.F.K.</strong></p>',

          "<p>The Events page is made by two columns, the <strong>Filters</strong> column on the left and the Events column on the right.</p>\n<h4>Filters</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Filters</strong> column allows the visitor to filter the list of items shown in the Events column. The available filter are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Event type</li>\n<li>Dates</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Event type</h5>\n<p>The <strong>Event type</strong> filter allows the visitor to filter the events' list according to the available events types.</p>\n<h5>Dates</h5>\n<p>The <strong>Dates</strong> filter allows the visitor to filter by dates. First the visitor must select the type of the date match from a drop down list. The date match type may be one of the following: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Exact</li>\n<li>Before</li>\n<li>After</li>\n<li>In Range</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the visitor selects one of the three first types she/he then must set the date. A datepicker is available to help select the proper date easier and ensure that the date is supplied in the correct format (dd/mm/yyyy). If the visitor selects the last option, In Range one input appears to allow the visitor to input the appropriate end date.<br />The visitor must trigger the filter by clicking on the submit button.</p>\n<h5>General remarks</h5>\n<p>The filters work in combination. Each time a visitor selects a filter the filters themselves are also filtered and only the values that may be applied to the available subset of classpieces remain visible, thus enabling further filtering the results.</p>\n<p>Every search filter has a small <em><strong>clear </strong></em>button. This button clears only the selected values of that specific filter. There is also a generic <em><strong>clear all </strong></em>button next to the <strong>Filters</strong> heading that clears all the selected filters. </p>\n<p>When a visitor sets filters the filter values are stored in the memory. When the visitor navigates back to the classpieces webpage the filters are still active. This memory is reset when the visitor refreshes the webpage or opens it in a new window/tab.</p>\n<h4>Events</h4>\n<p>The events column contains the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the number of total items</li>\n<li>the search bar</li>\n<li>the limit dropdown list</li>\n<li>the pagination</li>\n<li>the list of events</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Number of total items</h5>\n<p>This number is updated when the visitor sets filters and/or performs a search to reflect the total number of matches.</p>\n<h5>Search bar</h5>\n<p>The search bar visibility may be toggled by clicking the lens icon next to the number of total items. The search bar has a generic search input where the visitor may enter a search term. This term is matched against the labels of the events and the results are returned. To submit the search the visitor may either press the enter key or click on the search button next to the search input. The search input contains a round x button that works as a clear search button, when a visitor clicks this button the search term is removed and the system returns all the events.</p>\n<h5>Limit</h5>\n<p>The Limit dropdown is where the visitor sets the number of items she/he wishes to view per page.</p>\n<h5>Pagination</h5>\n<p>The pagination allows the visitor to navigate through the available pages of events. The visitor may navigate to the first/last page, next/previous page or to a page number. The user may also input a page number directly, a feature that may prove useful when there is a very big number of pages.</p>\n<h5>List of events</h5>\n<p>The list of events contains a list of the available events per page. This list changes according to the filters set by the visitor and the search term. Each item in the list contains the thumbnail of a event and the label of the event.</p>",

        content:
          '<p><a href="../person/11598">John Blowick</a> (1888-1972), Tuam diocese, born at Belcarra, Co. Mayo and educated at St. Jarlath’s College, Tuam, where he was described as ‘a good looking boy, thin, frail, self-possessed, with a kind encouraging word for new comers’. He entered St. Patrick’s College Maynooth in 1906 and was ordained in 1913. Blowick understood postgraduate studies at Maynooth in 1914, and while still a student he had the rare distinction of winning, in a public concursus, the chair of Dogmatic Theology in Maynooth (he was the last Maynooth professor selected in that way).</p>\n<p>Several years earlier, in June 1911, Blowick heard a lecture on China by the Canadian missionary, Fr. Fraser, which made a lasting impression on him. In 1916 he met <a href="../person/12150">Edward Galvin</a> and subsequently resigned his chair as professor of theology to assist Galvin in establishing a missionary society. Formal permission for the Maynooth Mission to China was given soon after by Cardinal <a href="../person/39532">Michael Logue</a> and the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr <a href="../person/8101">William Walsh</a>, with the former stating on the occasion ‘It is a consoling thing, for men whose work is almost done, to see young priests go forward willingly in such a grand work, and without having the Bishops after them with the pitchforks. I thank God that the missionary spirit is still alive’. By the time of its formal papal recognition in 1918, the society had taken on its lasting title of the <a href="../organisation/3923">Society of St. Columban</a>.</p>\n<p>Fr. Blowick remained a central figure within the society, being elected Superior General in 1919 and was amongst the first group of Columbans to travel to China in 1920 to begin their missionary work. Before travelling to China, however, Blowick had given a talk about the great need for dedicated women who would serve with the priests in ministering to the needs of the poor in China. In the audience that day was Frances Moloney, a young widow involved in efforts to relieve the poor of Dublin City. Thus, in 1922, Fr. Blowick and Moloney co-founded the Missionary Sisters of St. Columban. </p>\n<p>One of the earliest members of the missionary sisters, Patricia Sweeney, would describe Fr. Blowick as ‘a man of great missionary zeal. Yet, as we meet him in those early days we do not find him carried away in any impetuous manner by this zeal. The development of his missionary vocation and his response to the action of the Holy Spirit seem to have tempered what, to priests and students who knew him well, was a naturally impulsive character. In this new phrase of his vocational response we find a clear-thinking, far-seeing, cautious yet enthusiastic shaper of a mission. Mission needs were studied and, by systemic effort, real needs were given priority’. A letter from 1918 sums up Blowick’s approach: ‘Everything depends on initiative, and prudence to a certain point, but not too much – too much prudence will keep us from doing anything.’</p>\n<p>Returning to the Columbans, Blowick was elected Vicar-General and appointed Director in Ireland in 1924. He was again elected to the Superior General’s Council in 1947 and taught theology at the society\'s new seminary at Dalgan Park near Navan, Co. Meath. When he was in his seventies Fr. Blowick undertook a journey that took him to the principal missions of the Society. Following his death in 1972, Fr. Blowick was interred at Dalgan Park.</p>\n<p>For information on other Maynooth educated members of the society, see <a href="../resource/94486">here</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<p>Neil Collins (ed.), <em>Those who journey with us: deceased Columbans, 1918-2016</em>, available <a href="http://disa-app02.sixfeetup.com:8091/columban/documents/those-who-journeyed-with-us-to-2016.pdf">here</a></p>\n<p>Tom Murphy, \'Dalgan Park: Columban Missions\', available <a href="http://www.shrule.com/?page_id=1760">here</a></p>\n<p>\'Fr John Blowick\' in <em>Missionary Sisters of St. Columban</em>, available <a href="https://www.columbansisters.org/fr-john-blowick/">here</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>October 2021</p>',

        label: 'Ireland’s ‘Popish Parish Priests’ in 1704 ',
        content:
          '<div>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Context </strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The registration of Ireland’s ‘Popish Parish Priests’ in 1704 represents one of the most valuable records concerning the island’s eighteenth-century Catholic clergy – the document covers the entire country for one year and provides relatively detailed information on each cleric mentioned. This includes their name, place of abode, parish(es), date of ordination, where they received orders, from whom (i.e. bishop) and two lay individuals acting as sureties or guarantors for each priest. In total, the document lists 1,089 priests, just over 800 lay sureties and several dozen Irish and foreign bishops. One would have to wait until the nineteenth century for a comparably detailed single source on the Irish clergy. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The reason for the registration of the Catholic clergy came following the end of the War of the Two Kings in 1691, when the Protestant controlled Irish Parliament passed a number of penal laws targeting the Catholic clergy and laity. One such piece of legislation, ‘The Banishment Act’ (9 Will. III, c.1) of 1697, ordered that all regular clergy (friars and monks) and higher clergy who exercised jurisdiction (bishops, vicars apostolic and deans) were to depart Ireland by 1 May 1698 or face arrest and deportation (for more on this act, see <a href="../article/sculking-about-the-towne-the-clergy-of-dublin-diocese-in-1698">here</a>). This was followed in 1704 by ‘An Act for registering the Popish Clergy’ (2 Ann, c.7) that focused on the secular clergy (diocesan parish priests) and sought to ‘be truely informed of the number of such dangerous persons as still remain among us’. However, the act decreed that the remaining ‘popish priests’ would escape ‘transportation’ if they registered themselves with the Clerk of the Peace at the next Quarter Sessions held in each county and county borough after 20 June 1704. To guarantee their peaceable behaviour, each priest was also to obtain two sureties of £50. The resulting legal status would permit a cleric to celebrate mass and administer the sacraments. They were, however, debarred from leaving their county or maintaining a curate. Those who failed to register before 20 July 1704 were to become subject to the penalties imposed under the 1697 act. One way to circumvent these restrictions was through conversion to the Established Church. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>It appears that the majority of Ireland’s secular clergy registered themselves in mid-July 1704. Amongst their number also were the the four remaining bishops in Ireland, alongside a number of regular clergy, who sought to obscure their true positions within the church by registering as parish priests. Thus, Archbishop <a href="81074">Edward Comerford</a> of Cashel registered himself as parish priest (PP) of Thurles; Bishop <a href="74590">Patrick Donnelly </a>of Dromore, ‘The Bard of Armagh’, registered as PP of part of Newry, Bishop <a href="../person/77739">John Dempsey</a> of Kildare and Leighlin registered as PP of Kilrainy; while Bishop <a href="82393">Michael Rossiter</a> of Ferns registered as PP of Killinick. Amongst the regulars who registered as parish priests were the Franciscan, <a href="76365">Paul Egan</a>, and <a href="../person/79288">Andrew Matthews</a>, a Cistercian and the Titular Abbott of Mellifont. Through such measures and the assistance of the lay community, many of these individuals successfully avoided detection and deportation over the succeeding years. In the long run, clergy numbers were not curbed by these restrictions. This fact was illustrated during the early 1730s by an Irish House of Lords investigation and their subsequent ‘Report on the State of Popery in Ireland’ (1732). The report noted that 1,445 secular and at least 254 regular clergy were residing in the country alongside the existence of over 1,000 mass houses, churches, private chapels and friaries. Writing in 1749, an English official would state ‘That was the state of Popery in 1732, and it is the general opinion, that it is not impaired either in numbers or influence by length of time.’. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The names and details of those who registered under the 1704 act were published in Dublin in 1705 by Andrew Cook, printer to ‘the Queens most Excellent Majesty’. Original copies of this document are extremely rare. This dataset was compiled from a copy owned by the Irish antiquarian, John P. Prendergast (1808-1893) - the archivists of the King’s Inns, Dublin kindly provided the Clericus team with access to this example. Two transcriptions of the original list were also published during the nineteenth century. William J. Walsh’s example was published across 6 issues (Apr. – Sept.) of The Irish Ecclesiastical Record in 1876. This is an accurate transcription of the 1705 original and the author details any changes/departures from the original text. A second version was published in the Irish Catholic Record in 1838 but contains several errors. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Content </strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Despite the attention that was given to the registration’s compilation and publication between 1704 and 1705, lists of sureties were omitted for Cork city, Donegal, Down, Dublin county, Fermanagh, Galway county and city, Kerry, Limerick city and county, Meath, Tipperary, Tyrone, Waterford city and county and Youghal. The location of ordinations for priests in county Down were also not included in the final document. Fortunately, the Clericus team located two additional copies of the registration and these permitted comparisons to be made between the documents. This analysis found no differences between the texts, and it must be concluded that the missing information was either not recorded by the respective clerks in July 1704 or was not forwarded to the authorities in Dublin prior to publication. The latter was most likely the case, given that any cleric who did not provide the requisite sureties would fail to fulfil the stipulations of the act and ‘shall … be committed to the common goal of the respective counties, cities, or towns … there to remain without bail or mainprize till he or they be transported’. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Besides the bishops and regulars already noted, there are several other well-known priests recorded within the 1704 list. This includes the controversialist and writer, <a href="76535">Cornelius Nary</a> of Dublin, the poets <a href="75526">Cornelius Curtain</a> and <a href="76365">Paul Egan</a> (Pól MacAodhagáin) and <a href="79118">John Gaffney</a>, an unfortunate Longford priest murdered by his housekeeper with a mallet in 1726. Otherwise, the names recorded within the 1704 list constitute, as Tomás Ó Fiaich observed in 1971, ‘the sum total of our present-day information concerning them’. This situation has improved during the intervening years with more research and the unearthing of sources held within archives across Ireland and Europe. However, in many cases this information remains fragmentary and dispersed, and it is in this context that the value of the Clericus project and database comes to the fore, by collecting and providing in one resource biographical information on Ireland’s considerable clerical population. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Excluding two Tyrone priests, <a href="74618">Denis Hughes</a> and <a href="74685">Roger Phelan</a>, who registered a second time in Armagh, the breakdown of clergy numbers per province is as follows: Ulster (187), Connaught (259), Leinster (352) and Munster (289). This provides a total of 1,087 individuals clerics (However, it must be noted that a further 5 double registrations are likely in the cases of <a href="77728">Matthew Cullen</a>, <a href="74399">Patrick Dornan</a>, <a href="78217">Anthony Coughlan</a>, <a href="78232">Michael Dillon</a> and <a href="78239">James Dillon</a>). County Galway maintained the highest number of priests in the country at ninety-five, which is unsurprising given the survival of a significant number of Catholic families amongst the county’s gentry and merchant classes. County Dublin had the second highest number of priests with a total of seventy. This number had fallen from eighty-six in 1698 as a result of the exodus of the regular clergy following the passing of the 1697 Banishment Act. Nevertheless, several Franciscans and Dominicans remained in the city and resided in Cook Street. The example of Dublin City also highlights that, despite being the centre of power in the country, priests were afforded a certain degree of anonymity amongst the capital’s population. As might be expected, the lowest concentration of priests occurred in northern counties such as Antrim (18), Armagh (19) Derry (14), Fermanagh (13) and Monaghan (17).  </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>A further significance of the 1704 registration are the insights it provides on priestly ordinations. A total of 255 ordinations took place on the continent, spread primarily across France (111), Spain (47), Portugal (32), Italy (18) and the Spanish Netherlands (34). The locations of ordinations within these countries were also varied and numerous. French ordinations, for instance, were spread across the country and included Paris (15), Bazas (19), Bordeaux (6), Angers (5) and Quimper (3). The close relations that existed between the south of Ireland and the continent are also reflected in the high number of foreign ordinations amongst the clergy of Munster and Leinster. Thus, of Kerry’s 36 registered priests, 27 were ordained abroad, including 24 in France. The next highest was Dublin (32), followed by Cork (26), Limerick (22), Tipperary (22) and Wexford (21). In contrast, more geographically remote counties in Ulster and Connaught often had few, if any priests ordained on the continent. Derry, Leitrim, Monaghan, Sligo and Tyrone recorded no foreign ordinations, while counties such as Antrim, Armagh, Fermanagh and Longford had just one example each. Nevertheless, this is not to say that priests from these counties did not benefit from continental educations similar to their counterparts from the south. In several known cases priests ordained in Ireland were later dispatched to the Irish colleges spread across Northern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. The ordinations that did occur in Ireland were carried out primarily by a small cohort of bishops that included <a href="74409">Oliver Plunkett</a> of Armagh (122), <a href="74430">James Whelan</a> of Ossory (132), <a href="74556">Thady Keogh</a> of Clonfert (116) and <a href="74475">Patrick Plunkett</a> of Ardagh and later Meath (115). </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The record of over 800 lay sureties provides the 1704 registration with a dimension not usually found in comparable sources of the time. Many well-known members of the gentry are recorded, often acting as sureties for several priests, and it is unsurprising that the church would turn to these families for their support. Notable entries include Valentine Brown of Kinturk, Nicholas Rice of Lissofin and the Colcloughs of Wexford. The island’s merchant community are also well represented in the list, particularly in Kilkenny city with names such as Langton, Archdeacon and St. Leger. Indeed, the list goes beyond (or below) the ranks of the better-known gentry and merchant classes to reveal the names, locations and professions of individuals who would be otherwise lost to history. Besides their counterparts amongst the gentry, the list reveals the presence of many individuals in rural areas with the titles of yeoman, farmer or husbandman. However, it is in urban areas that the most diverse range of occupations were recorded, including innkeeper, brewer, woollen-draper, cottoner, trunk-maker, mason and poulterer. In Dublin City in particular, the addresses of these individuals provide some insights into the business community in the city before more detailed directories became available later in the century. What is perhaps most interesting about this list is not necessarily the occupations of these individuals, but rather the possible religious identification of many. As might be expected, most surnames suggest these individuals were Catholics. Far less easy to explain are the presence of sureties with names often associated with Protestant families. Examples include Abraham Batton of Bandon, Edward Barnes of Tullamore, Ephram Huett of New Ross and Samuel Atkins of Leitrim. The presence of these names suggests relationships between members of Ireland’s different religious communities that serve to complicate, if not undermine traditional depictions of Irish history as simply a story of Irish vs English and Catholic vs Protestant. As W.E.H. Lecky once pointed out, ‘Irish history has many lights and shades’, and ‘the fascination of eighteenth-century Ireland’, Thomas Bartlett continues, ‘is that no one context appears to be wholly satisfactory.’ </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Of relevance to linguists and those interested in the evolution of place names are the spelling/versions of townland and parish names provided in the 1704 list. Before the standardisation of place names carried out by the Ordinance Survey during the nineteenth century, variation in spelling was widespread, and many names retained strong aspects of their original Irish forms. In Tipperary, for instance, several entries help to reflect the evolution of particular townlands from their Irish form to their modern English equivalents. In the western baronies of Clanwilliam and Owney and Arra, historically an area of mixed Gaelic and Anglo-Norman influences, we see these middle form names in operation. The townland of Kinkears in 1704 is derived from the Irish Na Coinicéirs (a rabbit warren) and corresponds to the modern townland of Nickeres. Similarly, the 1704 townland of Rossfuntion stems from Ros Fuinse (a wooded height or promontory) and is today known as Rossfinch. Another interesting example located further south on the Tipperary-Waterford border is the town/parish of Carrick-on-Suir. This area had been heavily colonised at an early date by the Normans, but the 1704 spelling of Carigneshure (Carraig na Siúire) highlights the continued influence of the Irish language in the area.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Transcription of the text </strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The transcription process retained all original spelling and expressions except where certain text was deemed superfluous, required clarification or would assist with the ingestion of the data into the Clericus system. Thus, under the heading for parishes served by a particular cleric, it was decided to retain parish names and drop any additional text unless it helps to better identify the location being referred to. For instance, ‘Coolenehilly in the Barony of Ownybeg’ was retained in its entirety, while ‘Popish Parish Priest of Ballymacky’ was edited to read ‘Ballymacky’. When the modern version of a name was known, the original spelling was retained as an alternate appellation. A similar approach was adopted regarding accents and capitalisation within the original text. Thus, both ô Haggerty and O’Hegarty are provided. Prefixes were also retained in their original form with the modern version provided as the main label. For example, Bryan mac Daniel was updated to Bryan McDaniel. Where variation in the modern spelling was present, the most common form listed at dúchas.ie was chosen: <a href="https://www.duchas.ie/en/nom" target="_blank">https://www.duchas.ie/en/nom</a>. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>To assist users to identify particular locations, place names found within the original text were modernised and the originals provided as alternate appellations. Given these place names were recorded over 300 years ago, oftentimes phonetically, it proved difficult in certain instances to match locations with their modern equivalents. In instances where a particular townland or parish could not be identified, the original was retained as the main label. In certain cases, a question mark (?) accompanies updated names where a possible match was found. Thus, the townland of ‘Duaghs’ located in County Monaghan was updated to ‘Doagheys?’. Users may notice that in many cases the names of parishes do not match their modern equivalents. The reason for this stemmed from the need of the clergy in 1704 to be registered in separate parishes. As a result, older and more numerous Medieval parishes were revived. Dublin City, for instance, which had nine parishes at the beginning of the eighteenth century was thus enabled to have thirty-three parish priests in 1704. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>As the civil authorities carried out the 1704 registration by county, the diocesan affiliation of each priest or parish was not recorded. The diocese within which a priest resided and ministered was identified by cross-referencing modern civil parishes, which generally correspond to the Medieval examples given in the text, with their modern equivalents within the Catholic Church. This in turn permitted parishes in the 1704 list to be matched with their relevant dioceses. County boundaries have also shifted in a small of number examples since 1704. This is evident in the case of County Offaly, where several parishes located in the northern part of the county are today found in adjoining counties. This can be observed in the townlands of Harristown and Kilbrennan which are today located in County Meath. Where this occurred within the text, the original 1704 county location has been retained within the Clericus database.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Sources: </strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><em>A list of the Names of the Popish Parish Priests Throughout the Several Counties in the Kingdom of Ireland</em> (Dublin, 1705). </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Tomás Ó Fiaich, ‘The registration of the clergy in 1704’ in <em>Seanchas Ardmhaca: Journal of the Armagh Diocese Historical Society</em>, vi, no. 1 (1971), pp 46-69. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Eoin Magennis (ed.), ‘Selected document: ‘The present state of Ireland’, 1749’ in <em>Irish Historical Studies</em>, xxxvi, no. 144 (Nov., 2009), pp 581-597. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Thomas Bartlett, ‘Review: Catholicism in a Protestant kingdom: a study of the Irish ancien régime by C.D.A.

          'Irish College Paris (ICP) entries added to the Clericus database',
        content:
          "<p>The Clericus database now includes over 2,000 new biographical entries relating to Irish clerical students educated in the Irish College Paris (ICP). Similar to other Irish colleges on the continent, the foundation of the ICP during the late sixteenth century stemmed from the attempted suppression of the Catholic Church in Ireland by successive English monarchs and their administrations. The Counter-Reformation requirement to set up Catholic seminaries and later, the restrictions placed on education for Catholics in Ireland by the Penal Laws, would eventually see 30 Irish colleges established across Europe, with the largest and most important of these being the Irish College in Paris. The college's 300 years of history was complex and mutifacted, and the reader interested in learning more about the college's story is directed to the following article <a href=\"https://www.centreculturelirlandais.com/content/files/History-CCI-English.pdf\">'The Irish Colleges in Paris,1578 - 2002: History'</a>.</p>\n<p>and other, oftentimes humorous, scandalous or tragic observations regarding students and their behaviour. Thus, in 1872 <a href=\"../person/66520\">Michael McCormack</a> of Cashel and Emly diocese was 'expelled for introducing brandy into the college', while several years later, <a href=\"../person/68100\">John Murray</a> of Cloyne diocese was 'detected in a secret and suspicious correspondence with persons outside; required to leave'.</p>\n<p>The value of the data to members of the public researching their family history is increased due to the inclusion of parents' names (including maiden names) for over half of the students. Almost 200 ICP students would also spend time studying at St Patrick's College Maynooth (SPCM), which in turn deepens our understanding of individual career paths. One excellent example to highlight this enrichment process is seen in <a href=\"../person/9027\">Kevin Clark</a> of Meath diocese, whose database entry draws on information from every resource utilised within the Clericus system thus far. </p>",

          '<p>The accompanying image is of the grave plot and memorial belonging to eleven deceased members of the Irish College Paris interred at <a href="../spatial/71907">Arcueil</a> (Cachan) cemetery between 1859 and 1891.</p>\n<p>In 1834, Dr. Patrick McSweeney, superior of the Irish College, \'purchased a country house of the college at Arcuil (sic.), one hour’s walk from Paris. It consists of a large building with six acres of land beautifully planted.\' For over one hundred years this house and its accompanying grounds, including a much used GAA pitch, played host to hundreds of young Irishmen being educated for the priesthood (see 19th century maps and plans of Arcueil <a href="https://archives-en.centreculturelirlandais.com/ark:74216/1eab6ba102876450a5490050569c4128.fiche=arko_fiche_5e7db3e80f034.moteur=arko_default_5f10436c8cf5a">here</a>). Canon <a href="../person/61318">Séamus Corkery</a>, who studied at the Irish College in the 1930s, writes that he and his fellow seminarians went to Arcueil twice a week, often on foot from rue des Irlandais in Paris (the Irish College), to play gaelic football and hurling matches in the grounds of the country house. \'We used to have mini All-Ireland’s…Competition was always keen,\' he writes, and at Christmas \'some enterprising student might get a goose from home and we would have a party.\'</p>\n<p>By the time Corkery revisited Paris (possibly during the early 1990s), the house at Arcueil and its playing fields had long been demolished and replaced by council flats. Upon visiting the college graves at Cachan cemetery, he was dismayed to find the plots neglected as \'no one ever contributed to their upkeep\'. Following his return to Ireland, Corkery set about raising awareness of the abandoned graves and funds were made available for their upkeep. This included the grave pictured above. However, two adjacent plots belonging to the college have yet to be restored.</p>\n<p>All the individuals recorded on the grave memorial pictured above were either current seminarians and/or members of the college\'s teaching faculty (<a href="../person/60930">William Cleary</a>) at the time of their passing. The college\'s records provide the causes of death in several instances, such as consumption (<a href="../person/62920">John Fitzgerald</a>), small pox (<a href="../person/64875">Edward Kelly)</a>, typhoid fever (<a href="../person/71572">Michael Walsh</a>) and inflammation of the lungs (<a href="../person/69169">Andrew O\'Hanlon</a>). These sudden losses amongst such a young and closeknit community were often keenly felt by the students and faculty alike, as evident in the record of Andrew O\'Hanlon\'s passing, being described as \'a most edifying young man\'.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, two of the eleven deceased do not appear in the surviving college records (John McCann and Patrick Campbell). Many more students died in Ireland having returned home due to illness or while on vacation - consumption, pneumonia and meningitis appear to have been the main causes of death, while alcohol abuse and a gun accident are also noted. The college archive further records the loss of nearly a dozen other students in France during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it is to be assumed that several are interred in the two Arcueil plots in need of restoration. Some of the individuals who were possibly laid to rest in these plots are:</p>\n<p><a href="../person/67493">Anthony Meehan</a> (d. 6-02-1921)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/62082">Hugh Dever</a> (d. 30-06-1856)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/62842">James Finegan</a> (d. c.1913)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/65698">Michael Mackey</a> (d. 5-12-1852)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/66188">Bernard McCabe</a> (d. c.1903)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/66595">James McDavin</a>/McDavitt/McDevitt (d. 3-10-1853)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/66663">James McDonnell</a> (d. c.1896)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/67141">Peter McKeone</a> (d. c.1898)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/62908">James Fitzgerald</a> (d. 14-09-1853)</p>\n<p><a href="../person/67123">William McKenna</a> (d.
